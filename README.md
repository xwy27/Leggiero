## Introduction

Taking light and convenience into consideration, a simple web server is used: `koa2`, which is unlike the most website construction - SPA front-end with URL forwarding and back-end server providing data.

Under the developing process, some koa middleware are picked:

1. koa-body:  *parse web request data into json*
2. koa-router:  *router control*
3. koa-send:  *server sending file*
4. koa-session:  *session control*
5. koa2-static-middleware:  *static file forward*
6. nunjucks:  *web page template*

`Semantic`, which concerns more about page displaying and is based on `jQuery` is chosen as the front-end frame work. According to some discussion of `jQuery`, `axios` is used for the web request.

After all, this is a toy for myself. I tried to modify the code and learn from it. Hope more helpful things can be done to it. 

**Your advice is welcomed.**
